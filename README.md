# 2-DDesignClass
Some 2-D design projects. Has basic giles in it right now, but i plan on creating some sort of algorithm to block out sensitive numbers or addresses in a picture.

Week of 9/8/2021
Created a basic black and white picture processing program, a program that writes words on to a basic java graphic window , a randomizer for an image 
(just randomizes the picture pixels), and an attempt to create a program that makes a picture whiter/brighter while also creating a black border around the image.
Goals for next week
  - Attempt to fix my border issue. Bottom right of m border is non-existant
  - Attempt to modify my algorithm so that it not just whitens, but actually just brightenss the image.
  - Start looking at blurring an image and attempt to code that so that I can move forward in the project
